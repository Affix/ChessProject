    * Private - Fork a copy onto your local machine (Download the repo), or private Repo if you have one.   
2. Choose which language you are most comfortable completing this in - you have a choice of PHP, Java, C#  
3. Read the documentation for the project and follow the instructions  
4. Commit updated code to your repo for the project (please maintain an offline repo if doing this privately)  
5. Once complete  
    * Public - notify [@LogicNow-Jonny](https://github.com/LogicNow-Jonny) - add this user with read access to the repo.  
    * Private - zip up your repo and email (or upload to your Cloud Storage product of choice and email link) to [jonathan.baird@logicnow.com](mailto:jonathan.baird@logicnow.com?subject=Developer ChessProject Completed)
